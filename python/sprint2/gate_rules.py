check_entry() is the decision engine. It does NOT print or ask for input -
it only takes facts in and hands a result code back. That is what makes it
unit-testable (QA and CCA are writing tests against it RIGHT NOW).

Result codes (exact strings - tests compare them, spelling matters):
    "GRANTED"                Patron may ride
    "GRANTED_VIP"            VIP may ride (fast lane)
    "DENIED_NO_TICKET"       ticket type is UNAUTHORIZED, missing, or unknown
    "DENIED_INVALID"         height or age is impossible (bad scan)
    "DENIED_TOO_SHORT"       under 48 inches - applies to VIPs too
    "DENIED_NEEDS_GUARDIAN"  under 13 with no guardian present
